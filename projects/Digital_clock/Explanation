🕒 Overview

This is a digital clock application with a graphical interface that:

Displays the current time

Updates the time every second

Has a menu to switch between Light and Dark themes

🧩 Code Explanation (Step by Step)
🔹 1. Import Required Libraries

import tkinter as tk
from time import strftime
tkinter is used for creating the GUI.

strftime from the time module is used to get the current time in a formatted string.

🔹 2. Theme Functions – Light & Dark
These functions define how the clock looks in different themes.

✅ Light Theme:

def light_theme():
    frame = tk.Frame(root, bg="white")
    ...
    lbl_1 = tk.Label(frame, ..., background='White', foreground='black')
Creates a new frame with a white background.

Adds a label with black text to show time.

✅ Dark Theme:

def dark_theme():
    frame = tk.Frame(root, bg="#22478a")
    ...
    lbl_2 = tk.Label(frame, ..., background='#22478a', foreground='black')
Similar to light theme but with a dark blue (#22478a) background.

🔁 Inside both:

def time():
    string = strftime('%I:%M:%S %p')  # Example: 09:52:03 PM
    lbl_X.config(text=string)
    lbl_X.after(1000, time)
This nested time() function updates the clock label every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

🔹 3. GUI Window Setup

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Digital-Clock")
canvas = tk.Canvas(root, height=140, width=400)
canvas.pack()
Initializes the main window and sets the title and dimensions.

🔹 4. Default Clock Display

frame = tk.Frame(root, bg='#22478a')
...
lbl = tk.Label(frame, ..., background='#22478a', foreground='black')
lbl.pack(anchor="s")
This is the default clock shown when the app starts — using the dark theme styling.

🔄 5. Time Update Function

def time():
    string = strftime('%I:%M:%S %p')
    lbl.config(text=string)
    lbl.after(1000, time)
time()
Updates the main label (lbl) every second with the current time.

🧭 6. Theme Selection Menu

menubar = tk.Menu(root)
theme_menu = tk.Menu(menubar, tearoff=0)
theme_menu.add_command(label="Light", command=light_theme)
theme_menu.add_command(label="Dark", command=dark_theme)
...
root.config(menu=menubar)
Adds a dropdown menu called “Theme”

Allows users to switch between Light and Dark themes dynamically

🔚 7. Main Loop

root.mainloop()
Keeps the application running and responsive.

✅ Output Behavior
On launch, you see a digital clock in a dark theme.

Use the menu at the top to switch between Light and Dark themes.

Time updates every second automatically.
